\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.1}{\ignorespaces Further analysis of the wind speed predictions provides a way for us to predict the axis along which the flag is blowing. The size and color of each marker is determined by the predicted wind speed and the location of each marker is determined by the north/south and east/west components of the actual wind speed at the same time. The dashed red line is the normal to the projection axis determined by running linear regression between the predict and actual values.}}{7}
