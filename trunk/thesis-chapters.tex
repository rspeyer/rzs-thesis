\section{Background Information}
The Archive of Many Outdoor Scenes (AMOS) database \cite{jacobs07amos} has been collecting images from 835 webcams every 30 minutes since March 2006 and now contains over 40 million images. This database is the largest known collection of natural scenes collected from static cameras and as such offers a wealth of data to test our methods against. While there are cameras located across the world, we focus on those located within the continental United States so that we can collect accurate ground truth weather data.
